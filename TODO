- cleanup cowboy code
  - start code, move under our application supervisor?
  - unify cowboy handlers: validation, error reporting, polish
  - content-type: mix of json and text in different endpoint. Better?
- common tests: add small stress-test
- use native erlang json module for OTP>=27 ?
- separate "generic" utils (json, ...) from "tasks sorting" utils
- more tasks validation:
  - check task names are unique
  - check all tasks in "requires" exist - no "dangling" tasks
- tasks sort:
  - algorithm looks a bit complicated, think about better algorithm or reuse something which already exists, (erlang/digraph?)
    or just implement proper topo_sort for graph
- better types/specs documentation
- logging
